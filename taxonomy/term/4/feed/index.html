 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve had a proper virtual place to call my own.  So I&#039;m excited to get started with this one.  This site is built on Drupal 7.  A fast, simple, all be it somewhat stark, theme was thrown into place, and the site as is remains very minimal.  Though my design prowess is somewhat lacking, I must say that the very basic simplicity of the theme is exciting to me as I think it represents what I would like this site to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I envision this site, not only as a blog to post discovery and discussion on Drupal and web development, but also as a sandbox.  A perpetual work in progress, combining technical writing with working proof of concepts.  But ideas evolve and should be allowed the freedom to do so.  That being said I will try and stay very open to how this site will develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramblings and validations aside, welcome to theoleschool.com!  Look around, and check it out. If you have any thoughts, ideas, or questions feel free to comment, or &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;contact me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
