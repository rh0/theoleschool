#Retirement of theoleschool.com

The time has come to put theoleschool.com into retirement (for now.)  I have not created a new blog post in quite some time, and keeping up with the security updates on an otherwise unused Drupal site has become a PITA.  I notice that there is still some traffic to a couple of these posts, so I thought I would leave the posts up in a static form.  Further I am moving the site to GitHub Pages, so that I may shut down the old server that theoleschool lived on.

For the curious I used [HTTrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack) to scrape the drupal site, and arrange the static site.  It took a minimal amount of cleanup after the site was crawled and dumped to flat files.
